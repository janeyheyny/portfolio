# Introduction

This is my personal portfolio site — designed and developed to showcase my work as a **UX Engineer**, focusing on thoughtful design, accessible interfaces, and clean front-end implementation.

The site is built with **Astro**, using simple, modular components and a content-driven structure. Animations are implemented with **GSAP**, kept subtle and purposeful.

# Goals

- Present projects with clarity and context
- Demonstrate UX thinking and front-end execution
- Keep the experience fast, accessible, and respectful of users
- Maintain a simple, maintainable codebase

# Accessibility

I aim to build interfaces that are usable for everyone.
This project includes:

- semantic HTML
- keyboard-friendly navigation
- visible focus states

# Tech Stack

- **Astro** — static site framework
- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript**
- **GSAP** — motion & micro-interactions
- **JSON content files** — structured project data

No heavy frameworks. No CMS.
Just clear architecture and fundamentals.

# Commit Naming

This project follows a lightweight Conventional Commits style to keep the history clear and meaningful:

- `feat:` new features
- `fix:` bug fixes
- `style:` visual or formatting changes
- `refactor:` internal code improvements
- `docs:` documentation updates
- `chore:` maintenance & tooling

I aim for small, intentional commits so changes are easy to understand. Please see [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for more.
